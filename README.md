# This repository contains my pattern matching algorithms implemented in C language.

maw22_22p.cpp contains 2 pattern matching algorithms: 1) with 2 adjacent search windows and checking 2 characters in each (MAW22); 2) MAW22 with pointers (MAW22P).

RByteMAW22.cpp - MAW22 over 256-ary alphabet, little endian machine; number k of significant bits in bad-character suffixes is defined in the programm;

RByteMAW22w2.cpp - RByteMAW22 with 2 sliding windows.

RBitMAW22 - search in a bitstream.
