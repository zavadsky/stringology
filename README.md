Bricks - algorithms primarily meant for short alphabets and long patterns\
Z/RZk Byte - algorithms primarily meant for large alphabets\
Z/RZk Bit - algorithms for binary search\


_byte_2w - The reverse Z-byte algorithm with k-bit read and 2 sliding windows, pointer current read position.

Zk_byte_3w - 'Left-to-right' Z-byte algorithm with k-bit read and 3 sliding windows, pointer current read position.

Zk_byte_3w_nop - 'Left-to-right' Z-byte algorithm with k-bit read and 3 sliding windows, integer current read position.

RZk_bit_2w - The reverse Z-bit algorithm with k-bit read and 2 sliding windows, for search in a bitstream.
