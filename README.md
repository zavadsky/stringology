# This repository contains my pattern matching algorithms implemented in C language.

maw22_22p contains 2 pattern matching algorithms: 1) with 2 adjacent search windows and checking 2 characters in each (MAW22); 2) MAW22 with pointers (MAW22P).

RZk_byte_2w - The reverse Z-byte algorithm with k-bit read and 2 sliding windows.
Zk_byte_3w - 'Left-to-right' Z-byte algorithm with k-bit read and 3 sliding windows.
