Bricks2q(k)DNA - pattern matching algorithms for genomic sequences.
Filtering expression style: T[i]>>1+T[i+1]<<1+...+T[i+q-1]<<(2q-3)
sigma - length of a shift one character to another in a filtering expression.
q - number of characters in a filtering expression.
'k' denotes that a k-bit mask is applied to filtering expression to limit the size of a shift table.
